                <p>This is the online portfolio of me, Diego. I am a programmer that has learned new technologies through interest. My interest for computer programming started young, as I have always loved to sit behind a computer and use it for anything
                    from programming, playing video games, chatting with people across the world, and doing work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have previously worked on both large and small projects like BattleMania, Simple Serialization, and Adaptable Configuration Language. When I was in the ninth grade in high school, I spoke with some of the developers of my school and
                    helped solve security holes in their web application. In addition, I worked with my father&#39;s company to help them design a CSS and JavaScript library named <i>Image Knobs</i>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have been programming for five years, and have built up most of my experience in Java. I have also worked with languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, and others. I have talked with people in commission work for experience in platforms
                    like Minecraft and Roblox, which helped me learn about it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Diego has been a programmer his whole life, and has always shown interest and willingness to participate in anything related to it. This site shows some of the work that he has done.
