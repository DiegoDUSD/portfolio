                    <p>This is the online portfolio of Diego van Schie. Diego is
                    a programmer that has been worked with many technologies.
                    His interest for computer programming started young. He
                    has always loved to sit behind a computer and use it for
                    anything from programming, playing video games, chatting
                    with people across the world, and doing work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Diego has shown himself to be able to be ambitious in what he 
                    wants to do. He has previously worked on both large and small 
                    projects like BattleMania, Simple Serialization, and Adaptable 
                    Configuration Language. When he was in the ninth grade in high 
                    school, he spoke with some of the developers of his school
                    and helped solve security holes in their software. In
                    addition, he worked with his father&#39;s company to help 
                    them design a CSS and JavaScript library named <i>Image Knobs</i>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Diego has been programming for five years, and has built up 
                    most of his experience in Java. He has also worked with 
                    languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, and some others. He has 
                    talked with 
                    people in commission work for experience in platforms like 
                    Minecraft and Roblox, which helped him learn about
                    commission work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Diego has been a programmer his whole life, and has always 
                    shown interest and willingness to participate in anything 
                    related to it. This site shows some of the work that he has 
                    done.</p>
