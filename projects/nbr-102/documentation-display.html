        <h2>Version: 1.02</h2><br>
        
        <h1>Application Documentation(Short)</h1><br>
        <p>This application's goal is to create a national breakdown, or 
        database containing information about a country. It can be split into 
        hard-coded, and soft-coded.</p>
        
        <p>Soft-coded content are things that can change, e.g. 
        DiplomaticFormat.txt, PresetList.cini, and SplashScreen.cini. The 
        majority of these files are written in CINI configuration, which is a 
        language created by Diego, which is a more complex version of Windows' 
        .ini file format.</p>
        	
        <p>Hard-coded content are the things that are not changed by the regular
        user, which are things like the complex menus, the main menu, the 
        "manage" menu, and nation management menu.</p>
        
        <p>As development continues, we hope to see more soft-coded content to
        help make the software to the user's liking, if they have the knowledge
        to change it.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h1>Application Documentation(Full)</h1><br>
        <p>This is an application to manage national breakdowns and statistics 
        about nations. It is can be explained by breaking it down into 2 parts. 
        The configuration, and hard-coded menus.</p>
        
        <p>The configurations are the things that can be changed without knowing
        how to code. It is currently expanding with the ability to soft-code 
        menus, which is currently used for the opening credits. It includes 
        documentation on how to write it, and should be able to be changed 
        without much difficulty. They are expanding to try to move a large part
        of the software from code, to reading the configuration files to be able
        to modify and add content on a whim. It uses CINI configuration files, 
        which is also designed by Diego. CINI configuration files can be 
        modelled off of .ini Windows files, but with brackets to created nested
        sections. It also uses quotes to signify text, numbers without quotes 
        to signify numbers, and "true" or "false" without the quotes to signify
        true/false or boolean values. It also supports indentation.</p>
        
        <p>Hard-coded menus are the ones that requires programming knowledge to
        change. Right now, they make up most of the menus and are the backbone 
        of this application. These menus include all the necessary logic, and
        there is the "create new" menu, which is to create a new database. There
        is the "main" menu, which is to perform an action, and the "nation" menu
        to edit the nation's properties. There are also a few other minors. This
        also includes the logic behind reading the CINI configuration files.</p>
        
        <p>This attempts to create a good experience using Java's Swing library,
        coupled with OS-specific look and feel. This will try to help the user 
        make the software fit in better in with the OS' software.</p>
